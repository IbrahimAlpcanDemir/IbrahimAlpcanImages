<p><br> Secret of London is a project that has been created by the event designer Ibrahim Alpcan Demir, who studied tourism and events management with focus on immersive and hospitality.</br>

    <br>Ibrahim Alpcan is a passionate event designer who came up with the idea of using authentic venues and turning these into a pop-up restaurant experience cooperating with guest chefs and Michelin star chefs from all around the world.</br> 
    
    <br>The concept is as the name already states a secret venue, which will be revealed 2 hours before the reservation. The menus vary depending on which guest chef is hosting the event.</br> 
    <br>Throughout the event many surprises will make our guests enjoy the evening and allow them to explore tastes and flavours that have not been experienced before.</br>
